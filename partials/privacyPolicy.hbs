                    Privacy policy is one of the essential legal requirements for websites.
                    Even if you only have a small business or a blog without any revenue, you may be surprised to
                    find out that you still need a privacy policy.
                    Basically, if your website collects personal data, you need a privacy policy that informs your
                    users of this fact in accordance with privacy laws in most jurisdictions, including EU and US.
                    Almost all modern websites work with the use of cookies, so the chances are high that your
                    website is collecting personal data, e.g. for statistical, functional or marketing purposes.
                    Learn below what a privacy policy is and how to get one for your website.
